Description: Projection pursuit is used to find interesting low-dimensional
    projections of high-dimensional data by optimizing an index over all
    possible projections. The 'spinebil' package contains methods to evaluate
    the performance of projection pursuit index functions using tour methods,
    as described in Laa & Cook (2019) <arXiv:1902.00181>.
